          <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-24 leading-relaxed">
            My path to ADHD coaching began with my own personal discovery. After years of 
            working with children with neurological differences, I began to recognize patterns 
            in my own life that pointed to ADHD.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-24 leading-relaxed">
            This revelation transformed not only my understanding of myself but also my 
            approach to helping others. I realized that my struggles with executive function, 
            organization, and focus weren't character flaws—they were neurological differences 
            that could be understood and managed with the right strategies.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            As a mother of triplet teenagers, I've experienced firsthand the complexities 
            of parenting while managing ADHD. This personal experience, combined with my 
            professional expertise, gives me a unique perspective on the challenges families face.

          <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-24 leading-relaxed">
            My career as a physical therapist began over 25 years ago with a focus on 
            pediatrics and brain-based rehabilitation. I specialized in working with children 
            who had neurological differences, developmental delays, and learning challenges.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-24 leading-relaxed">
            Through my work in early intervention and school-based therapy, I developed 
            a deep understanding of how the brain and body work together. I learned that 
            movement, sensory processing, and executive function are all interconnected.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            This foundation in understanding the neurological basis of behavior and learning 
            naturally evolved into an interest in ADHD coaching, where I could apply these 
            same principles in a different format.
