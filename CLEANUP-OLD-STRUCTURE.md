# Cleanup Old Structure - Summary

## What We've Done

### 1. ‚úÖ Removed Old Schemas from Code
- Removed imports for: homePage, aboutPage, servicesPage, contactPage, resourcesPage
- Kept only the new modular schemas
- Deployed updated schemas to Sanity Studio

### 2. ‚úÖ Created Cleanup Scripts
- `check-old-documents.ts` - Check what old documents exist
- `cleanup-old-schemas.ts` - Delete old documents (with confirmation)

### 3. üìä Current Status

**Old Documents Still in Sanity:**
- homePage (1 document)
- aboutPage (1 document)
- servicesPage (1 document)
- contactPage (1 document)
- resourcesPage (1 document)

**New Modular Content Ready:**
- ‚úÖ 2 Hero sections
- ‚úÖ 3 Services
- ‚úÖ 3 Testimonials
- ‚úÖ 2 CTA Blocks
- ‚úÖ 1 Team Member
- ‚úÖ 1 Home Page (new structure)

## Next Steps to Complete Cleanup

### 1. Delete Old Documents
```bash
npm run cleanup-old-schemas
```
This will:
- Ask for confirmation
- Delete all 5 old page documents
- Leave only the new modular content

### 2. Optional: Simplify Adapters
The adapters currently check for old structure first, then use new structure. After deleting old documents, you could simplify them to only use the new structure, but this is optional since they work fine as-is.

### 3. Remove Old Schema Files
After confirming everything works, you can delete these files:
```
sanity/schemas/homePage.ts
sanity/schemas/aboutPage.ts
sanity/schemas/servicesPage.ts
sanity/schemas/contactPage.ts
sanity/schemas/resourcesPage.ts
```

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before running cleanup:**
- The website is currently working with the new modular structure
- The adapters handle the transformation automatically
- Once you delete old documents, there's no going back

‚úÖ **After cleanup:**
- Sanity Studio will only show the new modular content types
- The website will continue to work exactly the same
- Content management will be much easier with smaller, focused documents

## Verification Steps

1. Visit your website - confirm all pages load correctly
2. Check Sanity Studio - see the cleaner structure
3. Edit some content - verify changes appear on the website

The migration to modular content is complete and working! The cleanup is just removing the old unused data.
